In the realm of human activity recognition, our project focuses on addressing the challenge of accurately identifying and classifying human activities in low-light conditions. We have implemented a cutting-edge Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LRCN) model, integrating LSTM, RNN, CNN, and GRU architectures, to enhance the robustness of our system.

Our dataset is meticulously curated to simulate arid environmental conditions, providing a realistic scenario for activity recognition in challenging settings. The LRCN model has proven to be exceptionally effective in capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in human activities, especially when visibility is compromised.

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) component of our model excels in retaining crucial information over extended periods, allowing the system to discern complex activity patterns. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) architecture enhances the temporal understanding by incorporating feedback loops, crucial for recognizing sequential activities. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) contributes by efficiently extracting spatial features from the input data, ensuring the model's capability to recognize distinctive postures or movements even in low-light conditions. Finally, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) further refines the temporal dynamics, offering a balance between computational efficiency and model performance.

By combining these diverse components into the LRCN model, our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in identifying various human activities such as walking, running, and stationary behaviors in darkness. The model's adaptability to challenging environmental conditions positions it as a valuable tool in surveillance, security, and safety applications where reliable human activity recognition is paramount.

In conclusion, our project leverages advanced deep learning techniques, specifically the LRCN model, to address the unique challenges of human activity recognition in low-light conditions. The integration of LSTM, RNN, CNN, and GRU architectures ensures a comprehensive understanding of both spatial and temporal aspects, making our model a robust solution for real-world applications in arid environments.
